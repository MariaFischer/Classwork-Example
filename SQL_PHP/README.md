# SQL/PHP
This repository contains some of my work in SQL - these are assignments or modified assignments for personal use.

# CS 275 - Intro To Databases
This is the large project of the class: Assignment explains the purpose, Project_Proposal_Warriors.pdf explains my preliminary thoughts/ideas, and Warriors_Project.pdf is my final write-up of the project. The object(s) to enter into the database I chose to be characters from my favorite childhood book series Warriors by Erin Hunter. This database is to catalogue each character - parents, age, job, clan status, home clan, etc. It is a combination of SQL and PHP.
